A Chrome extension that enables voice-to-text input directly in your browser, with optional Groq LLM-powered text enhancement.

## Features

- **Voice-to-Text Input**: Dictate text using your microphone within the browser
- **Real-time Transcription**: Convert spoken audio into text with the Web Speech API
- **Groq LLM Enhancement**: Optionally refine the transcribed text for grammar and clarity using Groq's high-speed LLM API
- **Seamless Text Insertion**: Insert text into the active input field at your cursor position
- **User Configuration**: Customize language settings and Groq API integration

## Setup Instructions

1. **Install the Extension**:
   - Download the extension files
   - Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions/`
   - Enable "Developer mode" (toggle in the top-right corner)
   - Click "Load unpacked" and select the extension directory

2. **Configure Settings**:
   - Click the extension's icon in your browser toolbar
   - Select "Options" from the popup menu
   - Set your preferred language for speech recognition
   - To enable Groq LLM enhancement:

     - Enter your API key in the options page
     - Toggle on the Groq enhancement feature

2. Start speaking when the "Listening..." status appears
3. Click "Stop Dictation" or wait for a natural pause in speech
4. The text will be processed (and optionally enhanced by Groq) and inserted at your cursor position

## Requirements

## Privacy & Security

- Audio is processed locally using the Groq ASR API

- No voice data or transcribed text is stored persistently by the extension
